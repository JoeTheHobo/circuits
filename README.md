# circuits
A cool little program that allows you to play with circuits. Though they are not normal circuits, or else you might as well you any other program. I hope you have fun, send any cool projects you made to johnjonesma@gmail.com

# What to do?
Load up the main.html file and you'll see a 30x30 grid ontop of a gradient background.
You are able to press on the different cells in the grid. When you press on one cell it will become whatever 'type' is currently selected.

# What is selected?
When the site loads the selected 'type' is set to '1' or 'empty'. Pressing on a cell with a 'empty' type will erase the cell.
Switching between the different 'types' is easy. Just press the numbers 1-8 on your keyboard. Here is what they all do:

1: Empty Cell. Has no properties, just erases cells.
2: Power Cell. Gives off power.
3: String Cell. Takes power and moves it.
4: Jump Cell. Takes power and moves it 2 cells away.
5: And Gate. Requires two inputs of power to send off power.
6: Reverse Cell. Reverses the power it takes. If it reseives power on then it outputs power off.
7: Senser. Checks all cells around and see if they are powered, if one or more is powered then this cell becomes powered.
8: Light. A black cell that when powered turns yellow. Like a light.

# Rotating the direction
Press the arrow keys to switch the rotation of the cell. Then click on the grid to place it. Default rotation is facing right.

# Saving and Loading Grids
To save a grid press Ctrl-S or CMD-S. A new window opens up, copy that code and save it wherever you want.
To Load a grid press Ctrl-V or CMD-V. Then paste in the code you saved and press enter.

# Thank you
If anyone plays around with this I would be super happy. I am a new developer and still is learning a lot to do with JavaScript. If you have any feedback please let me know, I'm trying to learn everything to do with Programming/Computer Science.

Thank You,
