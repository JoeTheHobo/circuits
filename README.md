# circuits
A cool little program that allows you to play with circuits. Though they are not normal circuits, or else you might as well you any other program. I hope you have fun, send any cool projects you made to johnjonesma@gmail.com

# What to do
Load up the main.html file and you'll see a 30x30 grid ontop of a gradient background.
To start off you're able to press numbers 1-8. All doing different things.
